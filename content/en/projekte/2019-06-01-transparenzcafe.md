The transparency portal of the city of Karlsruhe targets primarily interested specialists who want to realize projects with the data, which may then also be of interest to the general public. With the concept of the "Transparency Cafe" the OK Lab Karlsruhe wants to make the knowledge about open data and how to use it accessible to a wider public. With a series of events in the context of [*Seasons of Media Arts 2019*](https://zkm.de/de/veranstaltung/2019/08/datenlabor-workshop), we want to provide some inspiration for dealing with the data of the Transparency Portal in an informal »café« atmosphere. A continuation of these " Transparency Cafes", e.g. at district level, is being planned.
