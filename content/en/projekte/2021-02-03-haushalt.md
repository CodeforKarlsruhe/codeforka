Can communal budgets be analyzed and evaluated without first having to learn to program?

We have held several events in various formats on this question and now want to process the experience gained and make it generally accessible.

We are working on the following topics
* IT tools for citizens without specific IT knowledge for independent analysis and evaluation of structured data - especially budget plans
* Self-study courses
   * for "self-service" IT tools
   * on budgets: "Municipal budgets in plain language"
* Revision of the current file and data structures for budgets
* Publication of the results in a new version of the budget in the city's transparency portal

Are you interested in working with us or in using our solution for your city?
