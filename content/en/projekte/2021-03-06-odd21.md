The *Open Data Day* is an annual event to highlight the importance of open data internationally. On this day local groups organize self-organized events. Last year (2020) there were more than 300 events.

Regardless of age and technical skills - everyone can take part in the *Open Data Day* - whether newcomer or data expert.

This year these events around open data will take place worldwide on March 6 - mostly online. Open data and the tools to evaluate it create transparency and enable democratic participation through informed social decision-making. This is what we want to support.

In 2021 several OK-LABs participate in a larger event organized by the [OKNRW e.V.](https://oknrw.de/veranstaltungen/offene-kommunen-nrw-2021-opendataday/). We plan to contribute 2 sessions related to communal budget planning. Please check the [programm](https://oknrw.de/veranstaltungen/offene-kommunen-nrw-2021-opendataday/programmablauf/).
