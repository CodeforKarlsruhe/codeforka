We're planning to prepare a number of workshops on different topics, related to the **Critical-Zones** [exhibition.](https://critical-zones.zkm.de/). Register at ZKM:

 * [12.3.2021](https://zkm.de/de/fuehrung-workshop/2021/03/total-gaia-0)
 * [23.4.2021](https://zkm.de/en/guidedtour-workshop/2021/04/total-gaia-digital-1)
 * [14.5.2021](https://zkm.de/en/guidedtour-workshop/2021/05/total-gaia)

### Environmental sensors 
are the first topic. Two types of sensors will be used, 
a sensor which measures the total [volatile organic compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound) (*tvoc*, this is also the workshop label in this Wiki) in the room air and 
a barometric pressure and temperature sensor (*baro*).

During the workshop, we will only use one parameter from each of the sensors
 * CO2 from *tvoc*
 * Temperature from *baro*

You can extend the set of measurements on your own, later on.

Please check the [WiKi](https://github.com/digital-codes/critical-workshops/wiki/Welcome) for more information.

Please register via the [ZKM](https://zkm.de) website, program will be out by end of February.
