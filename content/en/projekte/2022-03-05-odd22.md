The *Open Data Day* is an annual event to highlight the importance of open data internationally. On this day local groups run self-organized events. 

This year these events around open data will take place worldwide on March 5 - also at Karlsruhe.
Open data and related tools can help to build transparency and democratic participation via well-informed decision-making in the society. To support this goal, the Open Knowledge Lab Karlsruhe invites interested people to this **online-** gathering.


Everyone can take part in the *Open Data Day* regardless of age and technical skills.


We'll start at 2pm with a brief introduction to open data

featuring a couple of projects going on at Karlsruhe and elsewhere.

In workshops on the following topics we will create data stories, together with you and including your own ideas:
 
 * Data preparation and data visualization
 * Data journey through Karlsruhe Open Data
 * Open environmental and geodata
 * Possibly in addition:
    * Environment and climate 

More information about the workshop topics can be found in the [Program flyer (German only)](/data/2022/oddWorkshops.pdf)

The results will be presented in the plenum and we will see if and how individual stories can be further developed.

Please register with an email to [odd@ok-lab-karlsruhe.de](mailto:odd@ok-lab-karlsruhe.de), we will send the link for participation in time. The event is free of charge. Event language will be German.
