The *Open Data Day* is an annual event to highlight the importance of open data internationally. On this day local groups organize self-organized events. Last year (2022) there were  153 events worldwide.

This year these events around open data will take place during March 7 - 10, also in Karlsruhe. Open data and the tools to evaluate it create transparency and enable democratic participation through informed social decision-making. To support exactly this, the Open Knowledge Lab Karlsruhe invites interested people to get to know and exchange ideas for the sixth time.

Regardless of age and technical skills - everyone can take part in the *Open Data Day* - whether newcomer or data expert.

We start the *Open Data Day* at 3:00 p.m. in the **media lounge of the [ZKM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/224089410)** with an introduction to the world of open data using the example of current projects from Karlsruhe and other labs. We have a number of talk on open data from different perspectives. Following we would like to discuss your ideas and questions. Short hands-on sessions on special topics will be possible as well - bring your laptops if you like.

  * 15:00 - 18:00
