The *Open Data Day* at the beginning of March is an annual event to raise international awareness of the importance of open data.

Around this day of action, local groups around the world organize self-hosted events – including in Karlsruhe. The general global theme this year is *Open Data to Tackle the Polycrisis*.

Again this year, in collaboration with partners from Karlsruhe, we can offer a more extensive program than before, focusing on opportunities to participate: the HackDays **Open Data for Urban Future**.

Is this only for *hackers* or IT professionals? **Not at all!** We follow the [Wikipedia definition](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack) and aim to use creative methods to improve things that do not yet work well. This requires good ideas not only from the programming and data community.

Regardless of age or technical skills – *Open Data Day* is open to everyone, whether a beginner or an expert.

You can find impressions from the 2024 event [here on YouTube](https://youtu.be/289RJwps2Sk).

## Timetable

 * Friday 5:00 pm - 9:00 pm
 * Saturday 10:00 am - 8:00 pm

The program for 2025 is still being prepared. Check out [last year's event](/projekte/odd24/) to see what was offered. Stay tuned!
