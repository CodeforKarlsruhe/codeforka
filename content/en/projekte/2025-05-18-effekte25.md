**Effekte: Underständ the Länd** 


Data shapes our everyday lives and provides valuable insights into electricity consumption, rental prices, air pollution, crop yields, and many other aspects of our lives.

With modern digital tools, we can now collect and analyze data faster and more efficiently than ever before.

The experts at OK Lab Karlsruhe are committed to making this valuable knowledge accessible to everyone.

In engaging short presentations and interactive demonstrations, they showcase existing data sources, available digital tools, and the skills you need to work with data yourself.

**Drop by and discover the fascinating world of data with us!**
