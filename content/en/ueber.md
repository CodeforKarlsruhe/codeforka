*Please note: this English translation is still work in progress*

We are people who want to improve Karlsruhe with digital tools.
Every month we host the Code for Karlsruhe Meetup, where projects are presented,
interesting lectures are listened to and discussed and crafted together.
Are you a coder, designer, journalist, politically active or just interested?

**Great! Let's move the city together!**

Here you can find out which options are available to [join us](/en/mitmachen).

As OK Lab Karlsruhe we are part of the [Code for Germany](https://codefor.de) network,
a program of the [Open Knowledge Foundation Germany](http://okfn.de/). The goal of Code for Germany is to develop applications creating new opportunities in areas such as citizen service, participation and state transparency and
to further open up governmental data.

Meeting spot: [Digital Lab](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1333212) at town hall Karlsruhe

You can find a presentation (in German) about our activities on the website of the
